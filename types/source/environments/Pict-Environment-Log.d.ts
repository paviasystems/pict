/**
* Pict browser shim loader
* @author <steven@velozo.com>
*
* This was born after writing about 10 views and copying basically the same
* mock environment read/write functions into the test harnesses.  It allows
* mocks or other types of communications back-and-forth to be configured
* as an environment for views and applications.
*
* To use this:
*
* 1. Construct a pict object in your favorite fashion:
*        let _Pict = new libPict({...Environment})
* 2. Require this; it's exported as a static subobject of the pict library,
*    so you can do:
*        const libPictEnvironmentLog = require('pict').EnvironmentLog;
* 3. Create an object that is your custom read data.  Any key that is requested
*    but missing will return empty.
*        const tmpContentMap = { '#SomeElement': 'SomeValue' };
* 4. Pass your pict through this to get the custom functions mapped into the ContentAssignment service:
*        let tmpMockEnvironment = new libPictEnvironmentLog(_Pict, tmpContentMap);
* 5. Now you can use your pict as normal, and it will log all of the read/write events out and keep a log of when they occurred.
